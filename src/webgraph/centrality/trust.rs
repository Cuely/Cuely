//! Algorithm in broad strokes
//! We first calculate the betweenness centrality for all nodes an choose top k as proxy nodes.
//! The distances from every node to every proxy node and reverse is then calculated and stored.
//!
//! During search the user can choose a set of trusted node. Every proxy node then gets a weight
//! of weight(p) = sum(1 / dist(p, t) for t in trusted_nodes). The top s proxy nodes are then chosen to be used during search.
//! For each search candidate, u, they get a score of score(u) = 1 / (1 + sum(weight(p) * d(p, u) for p in best_proxy_nodes))
