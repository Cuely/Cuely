# About Us

Cuely is an open source search engine where the user has the ability to see exactly what is going on and customize almost everything about their search results. It's a search engine made for hackers just like us. No more searches where some of the terms in the query arent used, and the engine tries to guess what you _really_ meant. You get what you search for.

## Our Values

- _Complete transparency_ -- You can view our code and follow the development directly on [Github](https://github.com/cuely/cuely)
- _Privacy focussed_ -- We will never track you. Period. And you can always verify this in our [source code.](https://github.com/cuely/cuely)
- _Immensely customizable_ -- We aim to give you the ability to customize everything about the search. e.g. block sites, boost sites, prioritize links from specific sites and much more.

Oh, and if we ever become evil (maybe by changing our motto) please take our code and start a competitor. The fact that you have this ability will make sure that our values will always be aligned with our users.

## How do you make money?

Well, currently we don't. We are bootstraped and trying to keep costs low. In the future we will have contextual ads based on your current search query and a subscription option without ads. Just to re-iterate; we will only use your current search to match ads and will never track you across searches.

We will also have a paid api for developers.
