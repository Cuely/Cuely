# We will always respect your privacy.

When using Stract, you can have peace of mind knowing that we do whatever is possible to keep your private information - private.
We mostly do this by simply not storing any of your private information at all. This keeps things simple, both for you and for us.

Here is a brief overview of your privacy:

- Searches are anonymous and private to you.
- We don't store your IP address.
- We do not use any web browser analytics or other frontend telemetry.
- We do not share any user data with any third parties.
- We collect only the data needed to provide and protect the service.
- We serve all images and other static content directly from our servers to prevent tracking from third parties.
- We use HTTPS encryption everywhere.

You don't have to take our word for these claims as our [source code is available to everyone.](https://github.com/StractOrg/stract)
