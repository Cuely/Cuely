# We will always respect your privacy.

When using Stract, you can have peace of mind knowing that we do everything possible to keep your private information the way it's supposed to be - private.
We mostly do this by simply not storing any of your private information at all. This keeps things simple, both for you and for us.

Here is a brief overview of your privacy:

- We don't store your IP address.
- We don't store any information that can be used to fingerprint your device, browser etc.
- We don't share any user data with any third parties.
- We collect only the data needed to provide and improve the service.
- We serve all content directly from our servers to prevent tracking from third parties.
- We use HTTPS encryption everywhere.

By default, we do store some usage statistics in order to improve the search results. Specifically the following information is stored for each search:

- The text used to perform the search. 
- The list of urls returned for the search.
- Whether or not any of the results were clicked and if so, which one.
- An id that is autogenerated and unique for each new search.
- A timestamp rounded down to the nearest hour.

This data is solely used to train our ranking models which improves the search results for everyone. We go to great lengths not to store anything
that can tie your searches back to you or even figure out which searches were performed by the same individual.
We hope you trust us with this limited data as it helps us improve our services tremendously. You can opt-out of this at any time from the [settings page](/settings/privacy) and we won't store anything at all.

You don't have to take our word for these claims as our [source code is available to everyone.](https://github.com/StractOrg/stract)
