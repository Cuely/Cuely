This document is inteded to be a somewhat informal overview of how trust centrality has been derived in order to hopefully give a better understanding of what trust centrality is. It is *not* intended to be of the same quality as a scientific paper and some details may be omitted for simplicity. My algorithm and datastructures teachers would probably slaughter me for the missing details and rambling if I handed this in as an assignment, but here we go

# High-level interpretation of trust centrality values

# Derivation/idea from harmonic centrality combined with distance oracles

# Choice of proxy nodes
